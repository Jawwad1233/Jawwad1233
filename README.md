## Hi there 👋

# Career Description![wp7956319](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4f15c02-b943-48de-9e5f-6cb65cedc156)

Although I am 16 years old and don't technically have a career yet, I want to go into something engineering-related and work with hardware. The reason for this is that in my whole life, I have been interested in technology. From a little kid, phones and computers have interested me, and now, I have diversified to building computers and helping friends and family learn about them. By doing so, many of my friends and family now not only know how to build computers but also fix their own problems. 

## Favorite hobbies 

I have a lot of different and niche hobbies that I like. One of my favorite ones is technology, especially hardware. I love building computers and keeping up with the latest tech news. I also like fixing and repairing phones and other devices. Another one of my hobbies is Formula 1. I have been watching this sport since I was like 8 years old, and still do to this day; it is one of my favorite things to watch. 

## Education 

I am a current high school student and going into my junior year. 

## Professional Experiences 

I have completed two internships and volunteered at a summer camp, where I took care of large groups of students and collaborated with teachers.
